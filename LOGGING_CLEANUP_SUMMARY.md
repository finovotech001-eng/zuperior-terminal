# Logging Cleanup Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Excessive Prisma Query Logs
**Symptom:** Terminal was flooded with SQL query logs like:
```
prisma:query SELECT "public"."Instrument"."id", ...
prisma:query SELECT COUNT(*) AS "_count$_all" ...
```

**Root Cause:** Prisma client was configured to log all queries in development mode.

**Fix:** Disabled query logging in both Prisma client instances:

#### `lib/prisma.ts`
```typescript
// Before:
export const prisma = global.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({
  log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
    ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] 
    : ['error'],
})

// After:
export const prisma = global.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({
  log: ['error'], // Only log errors, no query logs
})
```

#### `lib/db.ts`
```typescript
// Before:
new PrismaClient({
  log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
});

// After:
new PrismaClient({
  log: ['error'], // Only log errors, no query logs
});
```

---

### Problem 2: Repeated API Calls
**Symptom:** Terminal showed the same API call repeatedly:
```
GET /apis/market-data?offset=853&limit=500 200 in 390ms
GET /apis/market-data?offset=853&limit=500 200 in 360ms
GET /apis/market-data?offset=853&limit=500 200 in 415ms
... (repeated many times)
```

**Root Cause:** Background fetch effect was re-triggering when near the end of data (853/858 items loaded), causing an infinite loop trying to fetch the last 5 items.

**Fix:** Added better guards and logging in `app/terminal/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Added guard to prevent fetching when almost complete
if (totalSymbolsCount > 0 && instruments.length >= totalSymbolsCount - 10) {
  console.log(`[Background Fetch] Skipping - already loaded ${instruments.length}/${totalSymbolsCount}`);
  return;
}

// Added start and completion logs
console.log(`[Background Fetch] Starting from offset ${instruments.length}`);
// ... fetch logic ...
console.log(`[Background Fetch] Completed. Total loaded: ${currentInstrumentsList.length}/${totalSymbolsCount}`);
```

### Problem 3: Excessive API Logs
**Symptom:** Every API call was logged:
```
[2025-10-24T01:44:13.062Z] INFO  Market data fetched from database {"category":"all","offset":853,"limit":500,"total":858,"duration":"360ms"}
[2025-10-24T01:44:14.080Z] INFO  Market data fetched from database {"category":"all","offset":853,"limit":500,"total":858,"duration":"829ms"}
```

**Root Cause:** All API responses were being logged regardless of importance.

**Fix:** Added smart logging in `app/apis/market-data/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Before: Always log
logger.info('Market data fetched from database', { ... });

// After: Only log if slow or first chunk
if (duration > 500 || offset === 0) {
  logger.info('Market data fetched from database', { ... });
}
```

## ✅ Results

### Before:
- 🔴 Terminal flooded with SQL queries
- 🔴 Same API endpoint called 10+ times repeatedly
- 🔴 Every API call logged
- 🔴 Hard to see actual issues

### After:
- ✅ Only error logs from Prisma
- ✅ Background fetch stops when data is loaded
- ✅ Only logs slow requests or first chunk
- ✅ Clean, readable logs

---

## 🎯 New Log Output

You'll now see clean, minimal logs like:

```
[Background Fetch] Starting from offset 100
[Background Fetch] Completed. Total loaded: 858/858
Market data fetched from database (offset: 0, duration: 45ms)
```

Only errors and slow requests (>500ms) will be logged for market data.

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`lib/prisma.ts`** - Disabled query logging
2. **`lib/db.ts`** - Disabled query logging
3. **`app/terminal/page.tsx`** - Added guards to prevent repeated fetch
4. **`app/apis/market-data/route.ts`** - Reduced logging frequency

---

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Open Terminal** → Check console
2. **Should see:**
   - ✅ `[Background Fetch] Starting from offset 100`
   - ✅ `[Background Fetch] Completed. Total loaded: 858/858`
   - ✅ No repeated API calls
   - ✅ No SQL query logs
3. **Should NOT see:**
   - ❌ `prisma:query SELECT ...`
   - ❌ Same offset called 10+ times
   - ❌ Logs for every single API call

---

## 💡 When You'll See Logs

### Prisma:
- ❌ Queries: **Never** (disabled)
- ✅ Errors: **Always** (kept enabled)

### Market Data API:
- ✅ First chunk (offset=0): **Always logged**
- ✅ Slow requests (>500ms): **Always logged**
- ❌ Fast requests: **Not logged** (silent success)

### Background Fetch:
- ✅ Start: **Always logged**
- ✅ Completion: **Always logged**
- ✅ Errors: **Always logged**

---

## 🔧 Re-enabling Detailed Logs (If Needed)

If you need to debug and want to see all logs again:

### Prisma Queries:
```typescript
// lib/prisma.ts
export const prisma = global.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({
  log: ['query', 'error', 'warn'], // Temporarily enable
})
```

### All API Calls:
```typescript
// app/apis/market-data/route.ts
// Remove the condition:
logger.info('Market data fetched from database', { ... });
```

---

## 🎉 Summary

Your terminal logs are now clean and only show important information. The repeated API call bug is fixed, and Prisma query logs are disabled. You'll only see logs for errors, slow requests, and major events like background fetch completion.

**Restart your dev server** to see the changes take effect! 🚀
